<!-- /////////////////////// ES6: Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords /////////////////////// -->
////// Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.
//  A new keyword called let was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue with the var keyword.
let catName;
let quote;

function catTalk() {
   "use strict"; <!-- Note the "use strict".
                   This enables Strict Mode, which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions. For instance: -->

  catName = "Oliver";
  quote = catName + " says Meow!"
}
catTalk();
